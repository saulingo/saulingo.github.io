  <p>
People in Spain usually have a given name (<em>nombre</em>) and two surnames (<em>apellidos</em>):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>First surname:</strong>
    the first surname of a person X is the first surname of X’s father.
    This is the main surname and the one normally used in everyday contexts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Second surname:</strong>
    the second surname of X is the first surname of X’s mother.
    It appears mainly in formal situations where the full legal name is required,
    in a role similar to a middle name in English.
  </li>
</ul>
So I would write my name as:
<br>
Saúl Rodríguez (norma)
<br>
Saúl Rodríguez Martín (more formal, including second surname)
<br><br>
 <strong>Citations:</strong>  I would cite my papers as [Ro], not [Ma].
