  <br>  <br>

  
People in Spain usually have a given name (nombre) and two surnames (apellidos). 
The first surname of a person X is the first surname of the father of X, while the second surname of X is the first surname of the mother of X.
<br>
In my case,
<br>
Saúl - Given name.
<br> 
Rodríguez - First surname (inherited from my father).
<br> 
Martín - Second surname (inherited from my mother).

<br><br>

The first surname is considered to be the primary one, while the second surname appears mainly in formal contexts where the full legal name is required, in a role similar to a middle name in English.
<br>
So for example, in Spain I could write my name as:
<br>
Saúl Rodríguez (Normal)
<br>
Saúl Rodríguez Martín (Formal)
<br>
<span style="color: red;">Saúl Martín</span> (Never)
